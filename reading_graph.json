      "summary": "Two Manhattan stenographers, Annabel and Midge, spend their Saturdays imagining how they would spend a fortune. Their game escalates from a hypothetical million dollars to ten million as they roam Fifth Avenue, peering into jewelry stores and weighing luxury purchases. When they learn a necklace costs $250,000, the shock collapses their fantasy, revealing how wealth dreams shape identity and expose the emptiness of conspicuous consumption; Parker uses brisk dialogue and sly humor to critique materialism in urban 1940s America.",

Drawing on literary and cultural references (e.g., Edwidge Danticat, Toni Cade Bambara, Harsha Walia) and concrete scenes from Buffalo\u2019s Tops supermarket shooting to Gaza and urban Brazil, Sharpe weaves personal reflection with global history to insist that writing must name atrocity clearly and work toward livable futures rather than sanitize or acquiesce to devastation.",

      "summary": "Conversation with Jeanne is a late-20th-century narrative lyric in which Milosz stages a long, intimate dialogue between the speaker and a stand-in for the philosopher Jeanne Hersch. On the island of Guadeloupe, the speaker renounces abstract philosophy in favor of immersion in the sensuous, worldly present, reflecting on a thirty-year dispute with Jeanne, the question of a life worth living, and the vocation of writing as a form of witness. The poem\u2014part of the Provinces sequence (English edition published 1991)\u2014reads alongside another piece that voices anger at a society that forgets horror, underscoring Milosz\u2019s internal tension between intellect and lived experience.",

On the return voyage to Athens, Theseus abandons Ariadne on the island of Naxos; back in Athens, he neglects to replace the ship\u2019s sail with a white one as a sign of his victory, prompting his father Aegeus to commit suicide by leaping into the sea, thereby naming the Aegean Sea in memory of his loss.",

      "summary": "An analytic essay from Foundation Capital arguing that the coming AI era will create a trillion-dollar opportunity not merely by adding intelligence to existing data, but by establishing a durable, cross-system record of decisions. The piece introduces the term context graph\u2014a replayable, decision-centered lineage that links inputs, policies, approvals, and precedents across systems (CRM, ERP, support, incident management, etc.) to explain why actions were taken. It contends that traditional systems of record miss the reasoning behind actions, and that the true value lies in capturing decision traces and their governance, enabling auditable, autonomous workflows. The authors describe how agents operating in orchestration layers will need such context graphs to achieve reliable, scalable automation, and outline how startups and incumbents will compete over who can build the \u201cexecution path\u201d that preserves context. The essay blends enterprise IT critique with a forward-looking roadmap for AI-enabled business processes.
